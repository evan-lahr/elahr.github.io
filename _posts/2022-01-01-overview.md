Seafloor instrument frames hold many sensors, most of them expensive, and electronics don't like water. This guide aims to provide fundamental knowledge on the design and functionality of benthic instruments. The common components of benthic deployments are explained in each section, with an emphasis on what it does (and why), and some tips and tricks are given from lessons learned. I often use benthic tripods (pictured below) and taught wire moorings, so most of these posts will be in reference to preparing and deploying instruments on these frames.
