This guide outlines how to embed a section of sediment core into epoxy resin which will bind particles in their *in-situ* position. It is based off the methodology of *Pike and Kemp* (1996), and it exploits fluid diffusion as the means of epoxy permeation into sediment pore space. This technique disturbs sedimentary structures less than alternative methods which involve freeze-drying or vacuum pumps. It is generally low cost (<$400).

The recipe below is for a single microstructure slab 10 x 30 x 50 mm, which roughly matches the size of a thin section slide from Precision Petrographics.

You'll need the following supplies:

    600 ml deionized water
    2.2 liters acetone (hardware grade works, lab grade is better)
    1.3 liters Spurr low-viscosity epoxy resin mixture, in this mass ratio:
        23.6 NSA Epoxy Hardener
        16.4 ERL 4221
        5.72 DER 736
        0.4  DMAE 2

And the following equipment:

    1 narrow strip of 0.2 mm aluminum sheeting
    1 tray to serve as a "diffusion bath"
    1 airtight container to seal the bath
    1 scale precise/accurate to within ~0.1 g
    15 disposable 200 ml syringes
    10 disposable plastic cups
    10 disposale stir sticks (I use disposable forks)

**Note:** The sediment microstructure slab is highly susceptible to deformation the moment it is extracted from the core. Keep it temperature stable, submerged in liquid, handle it minimally, and get it into epoxy curing as quickly as possible. Once you have all chemicals and supplies in hand, it's time to start the process of 1) desalination, 2) dehydration, and 3) epoxy embedding.
