***Sediment microstructure***  reveals the sedimentological details of a small area within a sediment core. Fine hand tools and minimally invasive sampling techniques are prioritized to extract a small window of sediment from a core without destroying delicate features including fine layers, cross-beds, and grain contacts.

To do this, a small slab of sediment is extracted into a metal tray and later embedded in epoxy. To perform the extraction, you'll need the following supplies:


    0.2 mm Aluminum sheeting (Al 1060)
    scissors
    drill & 5/64" bit
    taught-wire sediment cutter
    metal receptacle
    deionized water

***1. Create diffusion trays***  
Using thin aluminum sheeting, perform the following steps:

Measure and mark the dimensions of your tray on the [0.2 mm Aluminum sheeting](https://www.amazon.com/10pcs-0-2mm200mm200mm-99-6-Aluminum-Sheet/dp/B07G2WFVY2/ref=sr_1_3?crid=1DJIQZ54SMZIK&keywords=0.2mm+aluminum+sheet&qid=1675155035&sprefix=0.2mm+alum%2Caps%2C657&sr=8-3). Drill away about ~1/2 of the metal from the sheeting via regularly spaced ~5/64" holes. Cut out the tray body using a scissors. Fold the cut sheeting into the tray body, creasing the corners to 90 degrees.

I often make trays that are **10 x 30 x 50** mm thick. The Z dimension is is thin enough for diffusion-embedding, and the X-Y dimensions cover a standard thin section slide (26 x 46 mm) with a small margin of extra.

***2. Press and extract a diffusion tray***  
Expose a planar section of core sediment, and gently press the tray face down into the sediment until the back plate barely reaches the sediment surface. Press the taught-wire sediment cutting tool into the sediment at one end of the aluminum tray, and drag the wire across the face of the aluminum tray. At this point, a thin slab of sediment has been isolated in-situ in the core, but it still needs to be removed. From here, I rotate the core face to be nearly vertical, and torque out the tray while minimizing disturbance to the core and tray sediment.

From here, the diffusion tray can be transferred to the first bath of the diffusion embedding process. Below are photos documenting the key steps of a microstructure slab extraction from a fine-grained sediment core section.
