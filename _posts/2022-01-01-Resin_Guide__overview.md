Geologists often use the microscopic structure of rocks to make observations of their texture and composition. From these observations useful interpretations of source lithologies, formation conditions, and deformation can follow. This practice is often absent from the tool belt of a core sedimentologist who studies loose sediment, but it's possible!

***How can a core sedimentologist leverage this technique?***

The steps laid out in this guide are simple: 1) isolate a slab of sediment, 2) artificially "lithify" it using epoxy, and 3) create the final product of your choosing, often a thin section or a polished XRF block.
