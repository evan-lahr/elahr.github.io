I am a PhD student at the University of Washington Seattle in the [School of Oceanography](https://www.ocean.washington.edu/){:target="\_blank"}. I study sediment transport and the formation of stratigraphy on continental shelves and submarine canyons using observational data from seafloor instrument moorings and sediment cores. I also develop mapping tools to augment field datasets (e.g., image segmentation, multipoint extrapolation via regressors). My work is currently supported by the National Science Foundation, USGS Pacific Coastal and Marine Science Center, the Quaternary Research Center, and the University of Washington.

This website is intended to function as a set of notes for myself an others to refer back to. I hope you find what you're looking for.
